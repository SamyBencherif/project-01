# Project 01 - 2023-06-19

## Abstract

This is something of a more complete game made from the template [3GW](https://github.com/SamyBencherif/3gw/tree/raylib). 

## Technical

This project contains 3D models, textures, and audio. Where I am trying to keep 3GW as a blank template, here I am introducing some material. This project also uniquely contains my own physics implementation for walking and room collisions. The world is lit using a baked lightmap.

## Game

Each room has it's own schtick. The first room is a port of 2D program, one room has minecraft-y block placement, one room as jumping.
